Version: 0.0.0.900
Author: Markus Haug
Maintainer: Markus Haug <markus.haug@ut.ee>
Description: After defining a target cohort (cohort we are intrested in) and a control cohort (cohort we use for general population or for comparison) the package workflow extracts medical interventions which are over-represented in the target cohort over observation period. The are different argument values users can experiment with such as topDogs (max number of exported eligible features), presenceFilter (% of people must have the intervention), prevalenceCutOff (if prevalence odds are less than the given value, the feature will not be extracted). This is a workflow for medical proccess investigation and feature extraction.
